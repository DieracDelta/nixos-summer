    <h2>What is this about?</h2>
    <p>
    The Summer of Nix is a two month train &amp& work project that will take
    place between August 2nd to October 15th 2021. It is made for anyone
    who wants to rapidly increase their Nix skills while doing useful work
    for the Nix and the wider FOSS community - all of this together in a
    remote team and getting paid a nice stipend. After the program, there
    will be opportunities for continued work as paid freelance contractor
    with the NixOS foundation.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Who is organizing this, and why?</h2>
    <p>
    The program is funded via the European Comission's Next Generation Internet
    Initiative and organized by members of the core Nix development team, the
    NixOS foundation, the NLnet foundation and Tweag. The wider goal is to
    establish Nix as one of the principal platforms for free and open source
    software. Concretely, this means packaging many free and open programs, and
    improving the general packaging situation in Nix. The program's is set up
    to train up to 30 participants to become at ease in the Nix ecosystem and
    to deliver as many packages as possible from a list of strategic projects.
    </p>

    <h2>For whom is this interesting?</h2>
    <p>
    This program is great for students, professionals or passionates who can
    spend the time over summer  to rapidly increase their Nix skills while
    doing useful, paid work. Experienced Nix packagers are also very welcome to
    participate in a mentoring role. What we need from you is commitment,
    motivation and basic Nix knowledge (you should know what a nix shell is,
    the basics of nixpkgs and the language as explained, for example, in the
    nix pills tutorial). Of course, also a reasonably fast computer and
    internet connection is required although we might be able to provide some
    cloud infrastructure.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Time Zones</h2>
    <p>
    The program is open to applicants from all time zones and countries.
    Although many members of the organization committee are based in Europe,
    training sessions and workshops will be adjusted as good as possible to
    work for the majority of participants and flexible arrangements will be
    found for others.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Compensation</h2>
    <p>
    The compensation is fixed to a base rate of 2750 Euro in all member states
    of the European Union and associated countries like Norway, the UK and
    Switzerland. For participants elsewhere, this base rate is adjusted with a
    factor taking into account purchasing power parity similar to the GSoC
    program. The precise stipend amounts will be communicated individually to
    succesful applicants.

    If you meet the requirements outlined above, that is mostly having a basic
    understanding of Nix, time in August and September and motivation to work
    with us, simply write a mail to summer@nixos.org with the following
    content:
    </p>
    <p>
    An organizer will contact you soon (within 7 days) after that to conduct a
    short 15min interview. We will select a first group of participants on May
    15th and a second on July 1st. Please understand that the number of
    participants is limited (30).

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <emph>Is a GitHub account required?</emph> -
      Yes
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>I am a student. Can I use this program as internship?</emph> -
      There is no universal answer to this since internship programs differ
      from country to country and even university to university. We are open to
      internships but please contact us so that we can figure out together
      whether it is possible or not.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>I'm not a student. Can I also apply?</emph> -
      Yes. We welcome any motivated individuals who want to learn
      state-of-the-art Nix, and have the time and ability to participate. Do
      make sure that you can take the 2 months full time learning and working
      with Nix. 
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>I don't know anything about Nix. Can I apply?</emph> -
      We expect at least basic experience with Nix, which would hopefully allow
      us to move you up to an advanced level during the course of the Summer
      Programme. The program is not about learning the fundamentals. So if Nix
      is all new to you and you find this kind of program interesting - deep
      dive into learning Nix straightaway, and make sure you are ready.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>I cannot program, do I need to?</emph> -
      Fundamental programming skills are required, but very profound knowledge
      is not. Nix packaging isn't software programming but making software that
      already exists easily available for everyone. This software can be
      written in various programming languages and so during the program you
      will need to figure out how to deal superficially with those language
      ecosystems that the software you are packaging uses and also sometimes
      with those of the dependencies.  Luckily, there are tens of thousands of
      packages already in nixpkgs to learn from.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>Which packages are we going to package?</emph> -
       We will package a number of cutting edge free and open source
      applications in the field of privacy and trust enhancing technologies, as
      well as tools aimed at search, discovery and discoverability. These range
      from tools to develop open hardware chips to fediverse applications, but
      all of them have one thing in common: they are actively developed libre
      projects community, funded through the ambitious NGI Zero programme.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>Who is going to mentor?</emph> -
      Mentors will be established community members.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>I could mentor. Are you looking for more mentors?</emph> -
      Yes, please write us an email.
      </li>
      <li>
      <emph>What is expected to be delivered at the end of the Summer of Code?</emph> 
      We aim to deliver about three new Nix packages on average per partcipant.
      On average is important here because some high value packages are a lot
      more difficult to package than others and this will be taken into
      account.

      <emph>Where can I get more information?</emph> -
      Please send us a mail to summer@nixos.org.
